# My-O.S.
A little operating system I'm working at. The repository may not be the tidiest place (I'll work at it) because the most important thing for me is the code.

Right now the operating system does... nothing. GRUB boots up as the bootloader, shows a list of O.S.-s to choose (there is only one, my O.S.). It autoselects the only one, and nothing more happens. It shows at text: "loading kernel.elf" and something more that I don't remember right now.
